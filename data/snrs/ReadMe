Description:
    This catalogue of known Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is an
    updated version of the catalogues of Galactic SNRs presented in detail
    in Green (1984, 1988), in summary form in Green (1991, 1996, 2004,
    2009, 2014), and on the Web (versions of 1995 July, 1996 August, 1998
    September, 2000 August, 2001 December, 2004 January, 2006 April and
    2017 June). (Note that version published in Green (1996) was produced
    in 1993.)

    This the 2019 June version of the catalogue contains 294 SNRs, and is
    based on results published in the literature up to the end of 2018.
    The basic summary data included in this catalogue for each SNR are its
    Galactic coordinates, RA and Dec (J2000.0), angular size, type, flux
    density at 1 GHz, spectral index, and any other names. Notes on these
    parameters, on possible remnants not included, and questionable SNRs
    listed in the catalogue are given in the full version of the catalogue
    on the Web. It should be noted that there are selection effects which
    apply to the identification of Galactic SNRs (e.g., Green 1991, 2004,
    2005, 2009, 2015), so that care should be taken if these data are used
    in any statistical studies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on SNR:
  This designation is based on the galactic longitude and latitude of
  the source centroid quoted to the nearest tenth of a degree. These
  are generally taken from the name used for the remnant in the
  literature.
Note on RAh, RAm, RAs, DE-, DEd, DEm:
  The accuracy of the quoted values depends on the size of the
  remnant. For small remnants they are to the nearest few seconds of
  time and the nearest minute of arc for RA and DEC respectively. For
  the larger remnants they are rounded to coarser values. They are in
  every case sufficient to specify a point within the boundary of the
  remnant. These coordinates are generally deduced from radio maps
  rather than from X-ray or optical observations, and are J2000.0.
Note on MajDiam, MinDiam:
  Usually taken from the highest resolution radio map available. The
  boundary of most remnants approximates reasonably well to a circle or
  an ellipse; a single value is quoted for the angular size of the more
  nearly circular remnants, which is the diameter of a circle with an area
  equal to that of the remnant, but for elongated remnants the product of
  two values is quoted, and these are the major and minor axes of the
  remnant boundary modeled as an ellipse. In a few cases an ellipse is not
  a satisfactory description of the boundary of the object (refer to the
  description of the individual object given the detailed catalogue entry
  on the Web), although an angular size is still quoted for information.
  For "filled-centre" remnants the size quoted is for the largest extent
  of the observed radio emission, not, as at times has been used, the
  half-width of the centrally brightened peak.
Note on S(1GHz):
  The flux density of the remnant at 1 GHz in jansky. This is not a
  measured value, but that deduced from the observed radio frequency
  spectrum of the source. The frequency of 1 GHz is chosen because flux
  density measurements at frequencies both above and below this value
  are usually available. Note that some young remnants -- notably
  G111.7-2.1 (=Cassiopeia A) and G184.6-5.8 (=Crab Nebula) -- show
  secular variations in their radio flux.
Note on Sp-Index, u_Sp-Index:
  The spectral index is of the integrated radio emission from the
  remnant, &#945; where S(&#957;) &#8733; &#957;<SUP>-&#945;</SUP>. This
  is either a value quoted from the literature, or one deduced from the
  available integrated flux densities of the remnant. For several SNRs a
  simple spectral model is not adequate to describe their radio emission
  because the spectral index varies across the face of the remnant or
  that the integrated spectrum is curved, and in these cases the spectral
  index includes the 'v' in u_SI. In some cases, for example where the
  remnant is highly confused with thermal emission, the spectral index
  is given as '?' since no value can be deduced with any confidence.
Note on type:
  S  remnant shows a shell radio structure
  F  remnant shows a filled center ('plerion') radio structure
  C  remnant shows a composite (or combination) radio structure
  S?, C?, F? if there is some uncertainty
  ?  object is conventionally considered a SNR although its nature is
     poorly known or not well understood.
Note on Names:
  Other names commonly used for the object. These are given in
  parentheses if the remnant is only part of the source. For some
  objects, notably the Crab Nebula, not all other names are given.

Remarks:
  The on-line version on the World-Wide-Web at

     http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/

  contains much more information on the individual objects,
  including many references, plus discussion of possible and
  probable remnants that have been reported in the literature
  but which are not included in the catalogue.
